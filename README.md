# ktimeclock

A KDE-4.x based timeclock and time-tracking application.

Ancient, and not likely to receive updates.

I wrote it long long long ago, somewhere around 1998, to help track my
time while working as a Consultant.  Helped me keep track of time, to the
minute, that I was spending on various projects for various clients.

As time went on, though, I found that I "used" it more, but "updated" it
less, eventually resulting in the app effectively just being pulled
forwards from QT2/KDE2 forwards to KDE3, KDE4, etc., with the minimal
amount of effort/work required.

So... "Your Mileage May Vary".

If you can get it working, great!

If you have troubles getting it running, well, I can try to help but no
guarantees.
