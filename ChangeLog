4.0.0	- ???
- Ported to KDE-4.5
- Removed a number of dialogs and configuration options that weren't used.

===============================================================================

May 8, 2002
- Updated KTimeclock to build properly against KDE-3.x.

Jan 29, 2002
- Updated KTimeclock to build properly against KDE-2.2.1, so that it could
  now be build properly on newer distributions.
- Fixed a bug in KTimeclock where it wouldn't always create the data
  directory to save the XML data file to.  It is now _always_ created if
  it doesn't already exist.
- Reworked all of the documentation so that it'd now build/generate properly
  with the new KDE-2.2.x documentation tools.  Brand new screenshots taken as
  well (although they look a lot like the previous ones) :)

Jan 17, 2001
- Initial rewrite/rebuild of KTimeclock for KDE-2.0.
