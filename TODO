TODO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- En/disable icons/actions depending on whether or not the clock is started or
  stopped.

- Check for and resolve hotkey conflicts.

- True session management; if the user logs out while this is running things
  should be saved exactly as they were when the app was last running.

- Export of timeclock information to a text file, so that people can load it up
  into a spreadsheet program.

- Show totals of time/earnings for project/sub-projects based on the tasks that
  they contain.

- Reports:
  - Should be able to run with output to either text or HTML.
  - Report "output" should be able to be sent either to a browser, to a file,
    or via e-mail to a specified address.
  - Should be able to be run on any of the following:
    1) Everything (e.g. a full daily summary)
    2) Top-level projects (e.g. a client summary)
    3) Sub-projects (e.g. a project summary)
  - Ideally, it'd be nice if it could be built in such a way that it could be
    run as a scheduled job and not require X to be running.  That way the user
    could have it run in the middle of the night to send off a set of reports
    and clear the totals for the next day.

- Daily notes:
  - Ability to find and attach a set of "daily notes files" to the reports.
    This would allow for users to be able to have a report showing not only the
    time that they spent working on things, but also a summary of their notes
    on what was run.
