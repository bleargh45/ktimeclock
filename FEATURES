List of features that I've already added into this version of KTimeclock:

- Save/restore window size + position
- unique application; only one of them can run at any given time
- panel docking
- save/restore column sizings
- auto-saving of timeclock data
- total time logged this session, shown in the status bar
- configurable toolbar (using XML based GUI stuff)
- XML data file
- auto-saves data file on exit
- Auto-imports data files from KTimeclock-0.x if no XML data file is found.
  - No explicit import facility provided, but this'll read in your old data and
    bring it forward for you.  It'll then save it as XML and use that format
    from there on.
- rates can be associated with any given item, to help track not only time
  spent, but amounts earned while working on a given task.
  - rates can not only be set explicitly (e.g. "75.00"), but also as relative
    to that of a parent item in the tree (e.g. "*2").
